Things to fix
=============

# Version 0.0.9

* optionsHelp() is named ambiguously; Think of a better name, depreciate old name
* Need to do a sanity check on depreciated method calls. They should throw a warning so legacy code failures are clear
* Need to remove older versions of opt from npm repository
* Need to remove package dependency caused by example code (e.g. markdown)
